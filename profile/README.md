# SSOReady

Hi there! :wave:

We're building dev tools for implementing Enterprise SSO. You can use SSOReady
to add SAML support to your product this afternoon, for free, forever. You can
think of us as an open source alternative to products like Auth0 or WorkOS.

Our core project is
[github.com/ssoready/ssoready](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready). It makes
implementing SAML a breeze. You can self-host, or you can use
[app.ssoready.com](https://app.ssoready.com) for free.

Some of our other cool open-source projects:

* Our [docs](https://ssoready.com/docs) are open-source. They live
  [here](github.com/ssoready/fern-config).
* Our [Python](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready-python) and
  [TypeScript/Node.js](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready-typescript) SDKs are open-source too.

## Philosophy

We believe everyone that sells software to businesses should support enterprise SSO. It's a huge security win for your customers.

The biggest problem with enterprise SSO is that it's too damn confusing. Most open-source SAML libraries are underdocumented messes. Every time I've tried to implement SAML, I was constantly looking for someone to just tell me WTF I was supposed to concretely do.

We believe that more people will implement enterprise SSO if you make it obvious and secure by default. We are obsessed with giving every developer clarity and security here.

Also, we believe randomly jacking up prices on security software like this is total bullshit. MIT-licensing the software gives you insurance against us ever doing that. Do whatever you want with the code. Fork us if we ever misbehave.
