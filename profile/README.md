# SSOReady

Hi there! :wave:

We're building dev tools for implementing Enterprise SSO. You can use SSOReady
to add SAML support to your product this afternoon, for free, forever. You can
think of us as an open source alternative to products like Auth0 or WorkOS.

Our core project is
[github.com/ssoready/ssoready](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready). It makes
implementing SAML a breeze. You can self-host, or you can use
[app.ssoready.com](https://app.ssoready.com) for free.

Some of our other cool open-source projects:

* Our [docs](https://ssoready.com/docs) are open-source. They live
  [here](github.com/ssoready/fern-config).
* Our [Python](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready-python) and
  [TypeScript/Node.js](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready-typescript) SDKs are open-source too.

## Philosophy

We believe everyone that sells software to businesses should support enterprise
SSO. It's a huge security win for your customers.

The biggest problem with enterprise SSO is that it's way too confusing. Most
open-source SAML libraries are underdocumented messes. Every time I've tried to
implement SAML, I was constantly looking for someone to just tell me what in the
_world_ I was supposed to concretely do.

We believe that more people will implement enterprise SSO if you make it obvious
and secure by default. We are obsessed with giving every developer clarity and
security here.

Also, we believe randomly pumping up prices on security software like this is
totally unacceptable. MIT-licensing the software gives you insurance against us
ever doing that. Do whatever you want with the code. Fork us if we ever
misbehave.

## Reporting problems

Please feel welcome to use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready/issues) or reach out directly at founders@ssoready.com. We want to know about any bugs you encounter, any features you'd like to request, or any questions you need answered. 

We take security *extremely* seriously. If you become aware of any potential vulnerabilities, **please contact us immediately at security-contact@ssoready.com**. You will receive a response within 24 hours; in most cases, you should expect an immediate response. Do not open a GitHub issue. Do not post on any forums. If you feel unsure about whether something matters, know that we will be very grateful even for a false alarm.
