# SSOReady

Hi there! :wave:

We're building dev tools for implementing Enterprise SSO. You can use SSOReady
to add SAML support to your product this afternoon, for free, forever. You can
think of us as an open source alternative to products like Auth0 or WorkOS.

Our core project is
[github.com/ssoready/ssoready](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready). It makes
implementing SAML a breeze. You can self-host, or you can use
[app.ssoready.com](https://app.ssoready.com) for free.

Some of our other cool open-source projects:

* Our [docs](https://ssoready.com/docs) are open-source. They live
  [here](github.com/ssoready/fern-config).
* Our [Python](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready-python) and
  [TypeScript/Node.js](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready-typescript) SDKs are open-source too.
